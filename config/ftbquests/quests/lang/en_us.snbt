		"In the Forgotten Lands, a long time ago, a warrior known as Kaelan wandered like a ghost. The once-mighty guardians of the realm now only knew him as the Lost Warrior—a title as heavy as the sword that hung by his side. Kaelan's heart was a vault of sorrow, for he had witnessed the fall of his kin, the valiant Knight of the Silver Flame, in a battle against the darkness that threatened to consume their world."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Haunted by memories of his comrades' desperate cries and the unyielding weight of guilt, Kaelan sought solace in adventure but found only emptiness. Each village he traversed whispered tales of grisly fae creatures and curses that wound through the forests like dark vines. Yet, it was not the monsters of the woods he feared; instead, it was the unanswered questions clawing at his soul."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"One moonless night, as he sat beside the flickering embers of a campfire, an old dark mage named Eldrin approached him. Cloaked in shadows, with a beard woven from the very strands of time itself, Eldrin's wisdom emanated like firelight. “What burdens thee, lost warrior?” the dark mage asked, his voice deep as the roots of the earth."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Kaelan’s spirit flickered beneath the dark mage’s gaze. “I seek answers,” he confessed. “Why did I survive, while my brothers fell? What is the meaning of this loss?”"

		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Hope illuminated Kaelan’s path as he set forth towards the Misty Woods. The journey was fraught with treacherous brambles and eerie whispers, yet he pressed onward, determined to reach the Oracle. As he delved deeper, the air thickened with enchantment and fog danced around him, embracing the darkness."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Finally, he stumbled upon a glade where the air shimmered like molten silver. In the center, a towering ancient tree stood, its gnarled roots twisted in intricate patterns. At its base, a small pool glowed with an ethereal light—the Oracle lay within."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Approaching the water’s edge, Kaelan was met with his reflection, distorted but familiar. “Speak your truth, warrior,” the waters whispered in a chorus of voices."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Swallowing deep, Kaelan poured forth his pain. “I was a protector, yet I failed. I watched my comrades fall. I want to know… why?”"
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"The waters churned, revealing images of his past—the faces of his fallen brothers, their laughter and bravery, the bloodshed they endured. But among them, he saw another figure: a dark warrior, stitched from shadows and malice, orchestrating the attack as if it were a cruel symphony."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"The Oracle’s voice resonated within him, “You, Kaelan, are not alone in your burden. The darkness was chosen. Your fate was entwined with this shadow because destiny weaves a fabric broader than the moment. To understand loss, one must first face the shadows within.”"
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"As the vision faded, a deep resolve ignited within Kaelan. The true enemy was not the darkness that snuffed the lives of his brothers but the despair that twisted his spirit. Inspired, Kaelan emerged from the glade transformed. He was no longer defined by his past; he would become a beacon of light for those lost in the depths of darkness."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"With newfound purpose, Kaelan began gathering the scattered remnants of the Knight of the Silver Flame, seeking out those who had lost their way, offering guidance, and igniting hope in their hearts. He trained warriors in skill and valor, teaching them the power of courage, honor, and resilience. Together, they battled against the emerging darkness, confronting the malevolent figure he had seen in the Oracle’s waters."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"Months turned into years, and each warrior he inspired became a thread in the tapestry of light, weaving a new story for The Forgotten Lands. The Lost Warrior found not only his answers but a family—one forged from pain, courage, and shared purpose."
		"{@pagebreak}"
		"In the heart of The Forgotten Lands, Kaelan stood, sword drawn and spirit ablaze, prepared to confront the darkness that threatened to return. No longer lost, he led his kin into battle. Together, they would honor the memory of those who had fallen, forging their own legends beneath the eternal sky, in a world where hope ignited the horizon."
